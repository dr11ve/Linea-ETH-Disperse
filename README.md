# Linea-ETH-Sender
A Python script for sending ETH to the Linea network. It reads private keys from Private.txt, recipient addresses from Recipients.txt, and proxies from Proxy.txt (optional). It checks balances, sends transactions with gas, and adds random delays. Requires the web3.py libraries and requests. Configure the RPC URL, gas, and files before running. Installation: Install Python 3.6+ and libraries: pip install web3 Requests. Run: python main.py.

Caution: Keep the Private.txt file secure. Test the testnet before using it on the mainnet.
